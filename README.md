# gRPC Product Management System

## Project Overview:
The gRPC Product Management System is a service-oriented solution designed to manage product information and inventory. It provides functionalities such as retrieving product details, listing all products, adding new products, and updating product inventory. The system uses gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) for communication between the client and server, ensuring efficient and lightweight inter-process communication.

## Project Significance:
This project addresses the need for a scalable and efficient product management system. By leveraging gRPC, it offers high-performance communication between distributed components, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time data synchronization and efficient resource utilization.
